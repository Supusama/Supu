## 🚀 Featured Project: Medicox

**Medicox** is my initiative to revolutionize the way medicines are delivered in cities. While groceries can reach your doorstep in 10–30 minutes, getting essential medicines quickly remains a challenge. Medicox aims to solve this by:

- **Connecting all local pharmacies** in one app
- **Fast medicine delivery** within 10–30 minutes in city areas  
- **Qualified doctor consultation** via phone or chat  
- **Transparent pricing** based on local shop rates  
- **Emergency ambulance service** to the nearest hospital  
- **Support for local pharmacies** and partnerships with leading pharma companies (like Sun Pharma, Abbott Pharma, and Mankind Pharma) for marketing and supply chain improvements

> Customer service and satisfaction is our main goal.  
> **Be safe, be happy with Medicox!**
